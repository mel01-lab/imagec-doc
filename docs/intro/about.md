# About ImageC?

**ImageC is an open source software for high throughput bioimage analysis.**

:class: full-image
```

ImageC provides an **easy to use graphical user interphase (GUI)** enabling the compilation of image processing pipelines for **Object detection and Quantification** from various types of microscopic images, particularly Brightfield images, fluorescence images and Histological images. It was optimized within a group focused on Nanovesicles and therefore offers a powerful set of templates optimized for **single vesicle quantification** in diverse in vitro and in vivo settings.

## Is ImageC suitable for me?

There are diverse commercial or open access image processing applications.
What is special about ImageC? Is it the best program to help me to quantify my imaging data?

### What is ImageC not?

- ImageC is not an universal image processing application like [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/).
- ImageC is not designed for individual image processing even if it could be used for this.
- ImageC is not designed "to make pictures look pretty".
- ImageC is not designed for manual image processing or object segmentation.

### What is ImageC?

- ImageC is designed for high throughput image analyzing and data generation.
- ImageC generates huge raw data sets that can be further processed using basic internal tools, R or Excel.
- Image C enables the user to build individual pipelines put together from a set of widely used image processing algorithms.
- ImageC is designed for fast processing of huge data sets or huge images (e.g. histological images/ whole well scans).
- ImageC is designed for reproducible image analysis (reusable pipelines that can be shared)
- ImageC provides useful data sorting algorithm that help with data managment (e.g. usage of image sorting based on known well formats)
